# toy_xcb

Toy UI toolkit that has purpose to give example of use
of [rust-xcb](https://github.com/rust-x-bindings/rust-xcb) and
[xkbcommon-rs](https://github.com/rust-x-bindings/xkbcommon-rs).

Quite useless by itself, but it is a good resource for learners.
Some modules, such as [key](https://github.com/rust-x-bindings/toy_xcb/blob/master/src/key.rs)
and [keyboard](https://github.com/rust-x-bindings/toy_xcb/blob/master/src/key.rs) are
however well developed and could be used in more ambitious projects with very few changes.
